    <h2 class="b-header">The Gift of Our Bodies</h1>
        <p>There is sooo much media thhat is constantly advocating new ways to 'look better' or 'be prettier.' But simply put, we all have a body to take care of that needs food, water, and movement. We should treat our bodies with respect and care, doing things daily to make it feel good and happy! Honor what your body is asking for! If you're craving something sweet, eat something sweet! If you feel sick, don't workout that day! It's okay to give your body what it needs!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Workouts: 
                <p>I love doing a mix of things each week for my workouts.For an example, on Mondays I might do a weight lifting legs day, Tuesday an upperbody weights day, Wednesday a full body workout with weights, or pilates, Thursday a rest day, Friday another leg day, and saturday cardio!! Love, love, love. And this weekly routine changes each week of the month! During menstration I might do more pilates and walking and yoga or go for a swim! Do what you body can handle! Take days off, go on a hike with friends instead of a workout. Dance! Do what makes you happy!</p>
            </li>
            <li>Skin Care/ Beauty:
                <p>Don't be too harsh! As a teenager with acne, I was doing SOOO much to prevent breakouts, but all the different skin care lines and home remedies and changing my routine all the time was terrible for my skin! Be gentle and patient! Use simple, clean products. And these should not be expensive! The only expensive products I own are serums that probably do nothing! But they're fun. The most important steps to a skin care routine are a gentle cleanser, micellar water, and moisturizer. And if you're having skin problems maybe a benzyol peroxide before serums and moisturizer.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>Food:
                <p>Lately I've loved not following recipies and just using what I have! It has made for some very unique meals! But the best ones have been the stir fries. I'll grab all the vegetables I have and chop them up and cook them with whatever meat I have and put it on top of rice and that's a well balnced meal!</p>
            </li>
            <li>Fashion: 
                <p>Wear what makes you comfortable! But always remember that the clothes you wear will never compare to the beautiful soul inside! Put on a cute outfit and smile! nd if you don't feel like smiling, wear black and be mysterious. That's cool too. U do u qween!</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
