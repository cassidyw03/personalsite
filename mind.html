    <h2 class="m-header">The Gift and Curse of Our Minds</h2>
        <p>Our minds complex. They are constantly gaining new information and reacting and storing and remembering. Sometimes we need to sit still. Let your mind not absorb any new information for even a couple minutes in the morning. Changing your way of thinkng can literally change the genetic makup of your body. So how can we change that genetic makeup for the better? Before you can make a change, you ust decide what you want the result to be. But be easy on yourself! Any tiny amount of improvement is still improvement! </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Painting:
                <p>An outlet I've always had it making something with my hands. Especially art, and especially painting. There is something so soothing and rewarding from creating something beautiful from a blank page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Piano:
                <p>When I was twelve I discovered that learning to sightread music and play the piano expanded my mind and let me outlet my emotions in a way I didn't have before. There is something so comforting in sitting at a piano and finding your hands play your favorite song from muslce memory. Connecting to music in anyway you can is a wonderful thing for your mind. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Plants:
                <p>Yay! Plants! They say that even having a plant in a room increases your happiness by 7%. Jk. I made that up. But it's probably true. Having a living green thing you water and wath grow is wonderful and a beautiful simple pleasure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Family & Friends:
                <p>Connecting with people and forming relationships is why we live! People need to be around other people. There is no substitute. Not even plants. :/  Working on making other people happy is something that always improves my mood. Which is kind of conterintuitive, but it indefinately works! When I'm in a bad mood, I like to make a goal to connect with someone that day, or to give someone a compliemnt, or make someone feel seen. And when you leave your home with that goal in your mind, your worries are diminished. Call your mom, invite your friend over, plan a date, enjoy the company of others. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
